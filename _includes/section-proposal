        <p> On May 30, 2021, Mel took Eddie to Olbrich Botanical Gardens. She led him around, 
            getting totally lost while searching for the mint garden. She kept saying, "I think there's one 
            more garden around here somewhere!" Thankfully we found it, or we'd still be wandering around 
            to this day.
        </p>
        <p> Mel gave Eddie a hand-painted picture book, got down on one knee, and presented him with a 
            ring. He said yes!
        </p> Afterward, we went across the street to Olbrich Biergarten for a surprise engagement party 
        with our friends. It was a total blast, complete with a vegan cake and a random lady venmoing us fifty dollars.
