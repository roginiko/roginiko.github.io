            We moved in together in early 2020. Perfect timing! During the pandemic, we cooked elaborate meals, 
            brewed tangy kombucha, baked exquisite loaves of sourdough bread, grew fresh mint, and spent every 
            moment within 10 feet of one another. We were very happy and cozy in our bubble, and we did not get 
            sick of each other.

            Soon, our family grew. We adopted Niko (age 11) and Purrogi (age 2), two rescued Russian Blue kitties. 
            Through some kind of magic, Mel could bury her face in their fur without an allergy attack. We are 
            obsessed with them. Because of their busy schedules, Niko and Purrogi cannot attend the wedding, 
            but we plan to serve some special drinks in their honor.
