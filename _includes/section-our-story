        </header>
        <p>We met at a pie party on Pi Day. Mel brought three pies, and Eddie came empty handed. But we both left hungry to see each other again.
        From there, Eddie flirted by posting Instagram stories about cheese curds. Mel flirted by forcing Eddie onstage at a story slam to recount 
        a deeply personal family narrative.</p>
        
        <p>At another party, Mel needed help with a glass earring stuck in her tragus. So in the middle of the night, Eddie whisked her away to 
        his creepy lab and tended to the earring with parafilm and wire cutters. She was not murdered or disintegrated in a vat of hydrofluoric 
        acidâ€”how romantic!</p>
        
        <p>One week later, we went on our first date at Genna's Lounge. We talked for five hours about  the nature of existence and our 
        dads cooking exclusively Hamburger Helper during our preteen years. Dates two through two hundred followed in quick succession.</p>
