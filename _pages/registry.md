    <p><i>As we begin married life together, we are most grateful for the love and support from our family and friends. We’re lucky to already have most of what we need for everyday life (except anything made of glass, all of which Mel has already broken). While we do have a few physical gifts on our registry (including unbreakable wine glasses), the gift we’d most love is help going on a honeymoon to Greece. Our plan is to visit the islands of Crete, Milos, and Santorini in late September, where we’ll eat great food, relax on the beach, and enjoy what we hear are the most amazing sunsets in the world. The biggest gift of all, however, is your presence at our big day. Thank you for your love, and we can’t wait to share pictures of our honeymoon adventures with you!</i></p>
